The master branch stores the current version of SMUC which has been finalized and tested. **Do NOT commit directly to the master branch.** Instead, commit to a test branch forked off from the master branch for your project. 

# Create Project Branch:

Click the **Switch branches or tags** drop-down menu and select the master (default) branch.

Checkout the branch for your project. 

Windows/Mac users can instead use the GitHub Desktop to make commits. 

# Making Commits:

The summary shows on the timeline. This should be a concise summary of changes made by your commit. If the list of changes does not fit on one line, continue into the description. 

# Create a Pull Request:

Create a pull request once you are finished writing and debugging your code.  Your branch will be merged once the changes are reviewed.
